# Buoy Data Quality Assessment

This noteboook aims to assess the wave data quality of [historical data](https://www.marinha.mil.br/chm/dados-do-pnboiaboias/boia-bacia-de-campos-bmo-br) of a meteoceanographic buoy located at the Campos Basin (Lon: -40.10, Lat: -22.80). Then, a simple  [global waves model](https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/product-detail/GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV_001_027/INFORMATION) is validated using the processed buoy wave data.
